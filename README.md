# UFOs

## Purpose
### The purpose of this project is to help Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 
### Deliverables would include:
####  1. Allow the user to filter the table for:
##### a. the city 
##### b. the state 
##### c. the country
##### d. the shape.


## Results
####  1.    The total number of employees getting ready to retire is 72,548 people.
####  2.    By far the larget titles about to retire are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff who account for the 50,842 out of 72,458 employees.
####  3.    As far as leadership there are only 2 managers and 3603 Technique leaders who are going to retire.     
####  4.    There are 1549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.


## Summary
#### The one drawback to this design is you actually would need to know the city, there are too many cities in the world to know that.
